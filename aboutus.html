		<h2>Overview</h2>
		 
			<p>
		
		
				IEEE SB RIT WIE affinity group focuses on the technical and managerial empowerment of female students of the college, through a variety of educational and networking programs. It is always on the path to fulfilling its mission of bridging the prevalent gender gap in the industry through a focus – driven initiative to identify and solve challenges faced by young budding female engineers. The branch at present plans to conduct various technical workshops and managerial sessions to provide students a platform to improve their technical and interpersonal skills and be future-ready. Also, it plans to hold monthly meetups to improve networking among its members.
		
				The branch has recently proved its worth in the Kerala Section as five of its budding members were chosen for receiving a travel grant to attend IEEE WIE ILS(IEEE WIE International Leadership Summit) at Bangalore and another team of five emerged as the winners of a hackathon conducted as part of WIE – Learn program by the Kerala Section.
